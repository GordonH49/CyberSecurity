CYBERSECURITY ESSENTIALS

- Defend the use of Cyber Space from Cyber Attacks

CYBERSECURITY CUBE

Framework to establish and evaluate InfoSec programs:

Goals              Data States     Safeguards

1- Confidentiality 4- Transmission 7- Human
2- Integrity       5- Storage      8- Policy and Practices
3- Availability    6- Processing   9- Technology

1. Unauthorised access - Prevented
2. Data not modified in a way of "tampering"
3. Access not unavailable

4. Transmission between information systems "Data in Transit"
5. Data at rest - stored
6. Performing operations upon data

7. Also 'personnel' - How people will apply policies / training of them.
8. Administrative controls / operations.
9. Software and hardware-based solutions.

TERMS

"Asset" - What are protecting
"Vulnerability" - Weakness / gap in protection efforts.
"Exploit" - How hacker leverages vulnerability.
"Threat" - Hypothetical event we protect against.
"Risk" - Intersection of assets, threats and vulnerabilities or probability * impact.

CAUSES OF vulnerabilities

Design and development errors
Poor system configuration
Human errors
Connectivity
Complexity
Passwords
User Input
Management
Lack of Staff training
Communication

CYBER ATTACKS

Untargeted / targeted ATTACKS

ACTORS

Terrorists > Violence
Thrill-seekers > Satisfaction
Insiders > Discontent

CYBER THREATS

-Malware - Software that performs malicious tasks on devices / network.
-Spyware - Form of malware, hides on device, providing real-time information.
-Phishing attack - Cybercriminal lures individual to provide sensitive data.
-Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) - Disrupt a network by flooding it with superfluous requests.
-Ransomware - Malware to deny access to system or data until ransom paid
-Missing?-
-Zero-day exploit - Flaw in software or hardware or firmware which is unknown to parties responsible for patching flaw.
-Advanced Persistent Threat - Access gained and remains undetected for while.
-Trojan - A backdoor in system.
-Wiper Attack - Malware with intention to wipe hard drive.
-Intellectual Property Theft
-Theft of Money
-Data Manipulation
-Data Destruction - Attempt to delete data.
-Man-In-The-Middle - Relays information.

CYBER THREAT SURFACE

- All available endpoints that threat actor exploits in internet-connected devices.

- The processes producing, delivering and relying upon information systems.

CYBER KILL CHAIN

Recconnaisance > Weaponisationsation > Delivery > Exploitation > Installation >
Command and Control > Actions on Objectives > (Retreat)

SECURITY PRACTICES

- Hardware not being used may as well be disabled / uninstalled.

- Removable storage media still uses outdated and unsecure file systems.

VM WORK

- Good Practice to remove admin account for occassional use.

- Disable remote Access

-Upload to GitHub

(Did powershell work)
